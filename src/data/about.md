# Intro

Hi, I’m Andrew. I am a university student specializing in data analysis and artificial intelligence, with a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems efficiently. I am currently working on an AI-powered privacy policy tool, where I develop solutions to simplify privacy policies, identify risks, and extract permissions or allowances with the reasons behind them. I enjoy exploring alternative approaches to achieve significant goals more effectively and efficiently.

In my free time, I like to read, hang out with friends, make future plans, and reflect on how I can grow and contribute meaningfully to the world around me.
